    "Let $B$ be an arbitrary collection of subsets of $X$ and let $C$ be the collection of all $\\sigma$-algebras containing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to show that $C$ is non-empty: By definition, $B \\in \\mathcal{P}(X)$. Further $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra because it is closed under complements and countable unions. Thus, $\\mathcal{P}(X) \\in C$ meaning $C$ is non-empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to show that there is a smallest member of $C$: Define $H$ as the set of all sets contained in $C$. Let $D = \\bigcap H$ meaning that $D$ is also a $\\sigma$-algebra containing $B$. Let $G$ be a set contained in $H$. Since $D$ is the intersection of all such sets, $\\mathbf{card}(D) < \\mathbf{card}(G) \\; \\forall G \\in H, G \\neq D$. In other words, $D$ is the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra that contains $B$. $\\blacksquare$"

Since $P$ decreases for finitely many iterations, it must contain an element with no elements in $P$ that are smaller. In other words $P$ has a minimal element. The strict linear ordering of $X$ implies that this minimal element is also the smallest. Therefore, all subsets of $X$ contain a smallest element meaning that $X$ is well-ordered. $\\blacksquare$"
